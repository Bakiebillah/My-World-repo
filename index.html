<h4>Descriptive paragraphs</h4>
    <p>in fiction and certain styles of journalistic or other nonfiction writing, a descriptive paragraph contains various details of the same thing, with each sentence adding new insight. A paragraph in a horror novel might describe how it feels walking around the woods alone; a love letter’s paragraph might focus on the details of your significant other’s eyes. No matter the context, descriptive paragraphs are meant to provide the clearest picture of your subject.</p> 

<h5> paragraphs</h5>
    <p> editorials and opinion pieces, persuasive paragraphs are meant to convince the reader of a specific point, with each sentence presenting evidence or reasoning to support that point. Like expository paragraphs, persuasive paragraphs may contain data and statistics, but here, these work to support an opinion rather than verify a fact. The trick to writing persuasive paragraphs is knowing how to assert your opinion without sounding preachy. </p>
